aboutbox.title = About jbead
aboutbox.text = <html><h1>jbead</h1><br>\
  This is <b>jbead</b>, a program designed to help<br>\
  you design crochet bead ropes.<br>\
  The creation of such ropes is described in e.g. <br>\
  the book 'Gehäkelte Glasperlenketten' written by<br>\
  Lotti Gygax. It is hard work to create such a rope,<br>\
  but the result is very beautiful.<br><br> \
  With <b>jbead</b> you simulate before you start <br>\
  working how your design will look like as a finished<br>\
  rope. You can make changes directly on the screen.<br><br> \
  After finishing the design, you can print out all <br>\
  relevant data including a 'list of beads', which is <br>\
  very useful for correctly arranging the beads onto <br>\
  the thread. <br><br> \
  <b>jbead</b> was written by Damian Brunold. It is <br>\
  freely available and licensed under the GPL v3. This <br>\
  means, you can use and copy it freely and you can <br>\
  create derivative works (if you are a programmer). <br>\
  Damian Brunold cannot  assume any liability for bugs <br>\
  and damage caused by using the program. You have to <br>\
  decide for yourself whether the program is useful for <br>\
  you or not. <br><br> \

  or by sending e-mail to info@brunoldsoftware.ch. This is <br>\
  also the address to direct bug reports or feature requests <br>\
  to. <br><br> \
  Have fun using <b>jbead</b> <br> \
